# WIN-EVENT SOUND.

-------------------------------

Inspired by "Shutdown Sound" by newagesoldier.com, but is more advanced.  
Created in AutoIt v3, for Windows 7/8/10.  

## Description.

This portable program plays custom sounds when the following 4 events occure:

- Startup/Logon.
- Shutdown/Logoff.
- Lock/Sleep/Hibernate.
- Unlock/Resume.

Developed primarily for use in Windows 10 (where the sounds mentioned below are hard-coded to be disabled, so they have no chance to be activated by registry tweaking or other methods) and Windows 8 (where the situation is not as bad, but requires tweaking the registry).

## Installation.

1. Download the program via "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP", unpack.
2. Launch and configure the sounds.
3. Create shortcut to the .EXE file and place it in:  
(All users) C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup  
Or:  
(Only for [username]) C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
